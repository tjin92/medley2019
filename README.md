# Film Medley 2019

## Layout

The final output should be the following:

* A conductor's score of the final arrangement in two versions: concert pitch and transposed.
* A score of each part of the medley in concert pitch, so that each part can be worked on easily without taking too long to compile.
* Parts for the instruments, transposed.
* An SATB choral score.

## Conventions

The following conventions should be observed:

* All notes should be written in English and in concert pitch.
* In the concert-pitch conductor's score, use alto clef for horns and alto sax, and bass clef for bass clarinet. All other instruments should use their usual clef.
